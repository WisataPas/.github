## 💎 **Project Overview**

**WisataPas** is a smart tourism recommendation platform built as a capstone project under Bangkit Academy 2025. It uses a combination of **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** to recommend tourist destinations in Indonesia, tailored to individual preferences and budgets.

With real-time destination data, interactive maps, and an intuitive interface, **WisataPas** helps users discover travel spots and plan their trips efficiently.

---

## 🌍 **Why It Matters**

In 2024, Indonesia saw over **1.02 billion domestic trips**, yet many travelers still struggled to access essential information such as costs, routes, or amenities—especially in remote regions. Unlike platforms that only display general information, **WisataPas** provides:
- ✨ Personalized recommendations
- 🗺️ Interactive destination maps
- 💬 AI-generated summaries using fine-tuned T5
- 💸 Budget-based travel suggestions

This empowers travelers to make informed decisions and supports sustainable, inclusive tourism.
