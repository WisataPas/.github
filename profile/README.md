## 💎 **Project Overview**

**WisataPas** is a web application that leverages machine learning to offer personalized tourism destination recommendations for travelers in Indonesia. The app aims to address the difficulty many tourists face in accessing comprehensive travel information—like routes, costs, facilities, and transport options—by generating suggestions aligned with individual preferences and budgets.

This system is designed with a modular architecture, featuring separate components for frontend, backend, and machine learning models—all of which integrate to create a seamless travel planning experience.

## 🌍 **Why It Matters**

Indonesia’s rich tourism potential is often hindered by fragmented or hard-to-find information, especially for budget-conscious travelers. Despite rising domestic and international travel figures, many tourists still struggle with inefficient trip planning. **WisataPas** seeks to fill this gap by offering:
- Intelligent destination suggestions.
- A clean and responsive user interface.
- Budget-based planning features.
- AI-driven recommendations based on real user needs.

This project aligns with the goal of **inclusive and sustainable tourism development** in Indonesia by making travel easier and more enjoyable for everyone.

## 🚀 **Project Goals**

- 🧭 **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest tourist destinations based on budget and user interests using content-based filtering.
- 💡 **Simplify Travel Planning**: Present clear, structured information like routes, costs, and facilities.
- 🤖 **Use Machine Learning**: Train a recommender system model with real tourism data to provide relevant suggestions.

## 💡 **How Did We Come Up With This Project?**

We identified a crucial gap in the tourism experience in Indonesia: a lack of easily accessible and budget-based destination information. Inspired by successful practices in other countries (like brochures in Thailand’s airports and train stations), and after analyzing domestic travel trends and barriers, we realized that a smart web app with recommendation features could significantly enhance trip planning.

Thus, **WisataPas** was born—an app that merges user preferences with real data to produce smart, budget-aligned destination recommendations.

---

## 🧩 **Project Structure**

Our development process is divided into three primary domains:

- 🧠 **Machine Learning**: Uses content-based filtering trained on Indonesian tourism data to recommend destinations.
- 📱 **Front-End (SPA & MPA)**: Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JS. Responsive, user-friendly UI designed using Webpack.
- ☁️ **Back-End (RESTful API)**: Powered by Node.js and Hapi.js, connected to a database to store and serve destination data and ML integration.

---

## 🛠 **Tech Stack & Tools**

**Frontend & Backend:**
- ⚙️ Webpack
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS
- 🌐 Hapi.js
- 🟢 Node.js

**Machine Learning:**
- 📊 Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
- 🧠 TensorFlow
- ☁️ Google Colab
- 📈 Dataset sourced from Kaggle and other public tourism repositories

**Collaboration & Development:**
- 🧑‍💻 GitHub (Version Control)
- 🖥️ Visual Studio Code

## ⚠️ **Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

| ⚠️ Potential Risk | ✅ Mitigation Strategy |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Tugas tertunda | Evaluasi rutin & timeline mingguan |
| Kurangnya pengalaman | Saling bantu dan belajar mandiri |
| Kegiatan mendadak | Fleksibel dengan revisi jadwal |
| Kurangnya dataset | Eksplorasi sumber tambahan (Kaggle, API publik, dll) |
